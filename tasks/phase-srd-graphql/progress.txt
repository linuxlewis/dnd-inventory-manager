## Codebase Patterns
- The 5e SRD GraphQL API at dnd5eapi.co/graphql uses union types for equipment (AnyEquipment = Armor | Weapon | Tool | Gear | Pack | Ammunition | Vehicle). Use `... on IEquipment { }` inline fragment for shared fields (index, name, cost, weight, desc).
- MagicItem is a simple OBJECT type (not a union) with fields: index, name, desc, rarity, equipment_category, image, variants, variant.
- Generated GraphQL types go in `src/generated/graphql.ts` — this directory is excluded from eslint via `globalIgnores(['dist', 'src/generated'])` in eslint.config.js.
- Backend dev dependencies (ruff, pytest, httpx, pytest-asyncio) are in `[dependency-groups] dev` in pyproject.toml.
- Import `srdApi` from `src/api/srd/client.ts` for all SRD GraphQL queries. Methods: `SearchEquipment({name})`, `SearchMagicItems({name})`, `GetEquipmentByIndex({index})`, `GetMagicItemByIndex({index})`.
- Equipment search results include `__typename` to discriminate union types (Weapon, Armor, Gear, Tool, Vehicle, Pack, Ammunition).

## 2026-02-07 - FE-030
- Installed graphql + graphql-request as dependencies
- Installed @graphql-codegen/cli, @graphql-codegen/typescript, @graphql-codegen/typescript-operations, @graphql-codegen/typescript-graphql-request as devDependencies
- Created codegen.yml pointing to https://www.dnd5eapi.co/graphql with typescript + typescript-operations + typescript-graphql-request plugins
- Added `codegen` script to package.json
- Created placeholder src/api/srd/queries.graphql with SearchEquipment query using IEquipment inline fragment
- Generated src/generated/graphql.ts (2734 lines of types + SDK)
- Added src/generated to eslint globalIgnores
- Formalized backend dev dependencies (ruff, pytest, httpx, pytest-asyncio) in pyproject.toml
- Files changed: frontend/package.json, frontend/bun.lock, frontend/codegen.yml, frontend/eslint.config.js, frontend/src/api/srd/queries.graphql, frontend/src/generated/graphql.ts, backend/pyproject.toml, backend/uv.lock
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - AnyEquipment is a union type — you MUST use inline fragments (`... on IEquipment`) to query common fields
  - MagicItem is NOT a union, so you can query fields directly
  - The codegen generates a `getSdk(client)` function that returns typed methods for each query
  - eslint needed the generated directory excluded to avoid lint errors on codegen output

## 2026-02-07 - FE-031
- Created full queries.graphql with 4 queries: SearchEquipment, SearchMagicItems, GetEquipmentByIndex, GetMagicItemByIndex
- SearchEquipment uses inline fragments for IEquipment (shared fields), Weapon (damage, range, properties), Armor (armor_class, stealth_disadvantage), Gear (equipment_category)
- SearchMagicItems queries MagicItem directly (not a union) with index, name, desc, rarity, equipment_category
- GetEquipmentByIndex has full detail inline fragments for all 7 union types (Weapon, Armor, Gear, Tool, Vehicle, Pack, Ammunition)
- GetMagicItemByIndex returns full detail including image, variant flag, and variant list
- Created src/api/srd/client.ts that instantiates GraphQLClient and exports `srdApi` via `getSdk()`
- Ran `bun run codegen` successfully, generating updated src/generated/graphql.ts
- All quality checks pass (typecheck, lint, backend ruff, backend pytest)
- Files changed: frontend/src/api/srd/queries.graphql, frontend/src/api/srd/client.ts, frontend/src/generated/graphql.ts, tasks/phase-srd-graphql/prd.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `srdApi` is the main entry point for all SRD queries — import from `src/api/srd/client.ts`
  - SDK methods are PascalCase: `srdApi.SearchEquipment()`, `srdApi.SearchMagicItems()`, `srdApi.GetEquipmentByIndex()`, `srdApi.GetMagicItemByIndex()`
  - Equipment search query returns union types — use `__typename` to discriminate between Weapon/Armor/Gear/etc in consuming code
  - The `equipment` singular query returns `AnyEquipment | null` (nullable), while `equipments` returns `AnyEquipment[]`
