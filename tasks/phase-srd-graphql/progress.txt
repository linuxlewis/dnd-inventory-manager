## Codebase Patterns
- The 5e SRD GraphQL API at dnd5eapi.co/graphql uses union types for equipment (AnyEquipment = Armor | Weapon | Tool | Gear | Pack | Ammunition | Vehicle). Use `... on IEquipment { }` inline fragment for shared fields (index, name, cost, weight, desc).
- MagicItem is a simple OBJECT type (not a union) with fields: index, name, desc, rarity, equipment_category, image, variants, variant.
- Generated GraphQL types go in `src/generated/graphql.ts` — this directory is excluded from eslint via `globalIgnores(['dist', 'src/generated'])` in eslint.config.js.
- Backend dev dependencies (ruff, pytest, httpx, pytest-asyncio) are in `[dependency-groups] dev` in pyproject.toml.
- Import `srdApi` from `src/api/srd/client.ts` for all SRD GraphQL queries. Methods: `SearchEquipment({name})`, `SearchMagicItems({name})`, `GetEquipmentByIndex({index})`, `GetMagicItemByIndex({index})`.
- Equipment search results include `__typename` to discriminate union types (Weapon, Armor, Gear, Tool, Vehicle, Pack, Ammunition).
- SRD React Query hooks are in `src/api/srd/hooks.ts`. `useSrdSearch(query)` combines equipment + magic items with a `source` discriminator field. `useSrdEquipment(index)` and `useSrdMagicItem(index)` fetch single items.
- Exported types: `SrdSearchResult` (tagged union with `source: 'equipment' | 'magic-item'`), `SrdEquipmentResult`, `SrdMagicItemResult` from `src/api/srd/hooks.ts`.
- When consuming `SrdSearchResult` in UI components, use `item.source` to discriminate equipment vs magic items. Equipment has `cost`, `weight`, `__typename`; magic items have `rarity`, `equipment_category` (non-optional). Use `'equipment_category' in item` to check for Gear-type equipment which also has `equipment_category`.
- The old `SrdItem` type from `src/api/types.ts` and old `useSrdSearch` from `src/api/srd.ts` are now unused — they will be cleaned up in FE-034.

## 2026-02-07 - FE-030
- Installed graphql + graphql-request as dependencies
- Installed @graphql-codegen/cli, @graphql-codegen/typescript, @graphql-codegen/typescript-operations, @graphql-codegen/typescript-graphql-request as devDependencies
- Created codegen.yml pointing to https://www.dnd5eapi.co/graphql with typescript + typescript-operations + typescript-graphql-request plugins
- Added `codegen` script to package.json
- Created placeholder src/api/srd/queries.graphql with SearchEquipment query using IEquipment inline fragment
- Generated src/generated/graphql.ts (2734 lines of types + SDK)
- Added src/generated to eslint globalIgnores
- Formalized backend dev dependencies (ruff, pytest, httpx, pytest-asyncio) in pyproject.toml
- Files changed: frontend/package.json, frontend/bun.lock, frontend/codegen.yml, frontend/eslint.config.js, frontend/src/api/srd/queries.graphql, frontend/src/generated/graphql.ts, backend/pyproject.toml, backend/uv.lock
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - AnyEquipment is a union type — you MUST use inline fragments (`... on IEquipment`) to query common fields
  - MagicItem is NOT a union, so you can query fields directly
  - The codegen generates a `getSdk(client)` function that returns typed methods for each query
  - eslint needed the generated directory excluded to avoid lint errors on codegen output
---

## 2026-02-07 - FE-031
- Created full queries.graphql with 4 queries: SearchEquipment, SearchMagicItems, GetEquipmentByIndex, GetMagicItemByIndex
- SearchEquipment uses inline fragments for IEquipment (shared fields), Weapon (damage, range, properties), Armor (armor_class, stealth_disadvantage), Gear (equipment_category)
- SearchMagicItems queries MagicItem directly (not a union) with index, name, desc, rarity, equipment_category
- GetEquipmentByIndex has full detail inline fragments for all 7 union types (Weapon, Armor, Gear, Tool, Vehicle, Pack, Ammunition)
- GetMagicItemByIndex returns full detail including image, variant flag, and variant list
- Created src/api/srd/client.ts that instantiates GraphQLClient and exports `srdApi` via `getSdk()`
- Ran `bun run codegen` successfully, generating updated src/generated/graphql.ts
- All quality checks pass (typecheck, lint, backend ruff, backend pytest)
- Files changed: frontend/src/api/srd/queries.graphql, frontend/src/api/srd/client.ts, frontend/src/generated/graphql.ts, tasks/phase-srd-graphql/prd.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `srdApi` is the main entry point for all SRD queries — import from `src/api/srd/client.ts`
  - SDK methods are PascalCase: `srdApi.SearchEquipment()`, `srdApi.SearchMagicItems()`, `srdApi.GetEquipmentByIndex()`, `srdApi.GetMagicItemByIndex()`
  - Equipment search query returns union types — use `__typename` to discriminate between Weapon/Armor/Gear/etc in consuming code
  - The `equipment` singular query returns `AnyEquipment | null` (nullable), while `equipments` returns `AnyEquipment[]`
---

## 2026-02-07 - FE-032
- Created `src/api/srd/hooks.ts` with three React Query hooks:
  - `useSrdSearch(query)` — Fires both `SearchEquipment` and `SearchMagicItems` in parallel via `Promise.all`, combines results with a `source` discriminator field (`'equipment'` or `'magic-item'`). Enabled only when query >= 2 chars. staleTime: 5 minutes.
  - `useSrdEquipment(index)` — Fetches a single equipment item by index. Enabled only when index is truthy. staleTime: 30 minutes.
  - `useSrdMagicItem(index)` — Fetches a single magic item by index. Enabled only when index is truthy. staleTime: 30 minutes.
- Exported helper types: `SrdSearchResult`, `SrdEquipmentResult`, `SrdMagicItemResult` derived from generated GraphQL types.
- All quality checks pass (typecheck, lint, backend ruff, backend pytest — 66 tests)
- Files changed: frontend/src/api/srd/hooks.ts, tasks/phase-srd-graphql/prd.json, tasks/phase-srd-graphql/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The `SrdSearchResult` type is a tagged union — use `result.source === 'equipment'` or `result.source === 'magic-item'` to discriminate, and `result.__typename` for further equipment subtype discrimination (Weapon, Armor, etc.)
  - `useSrdSearch` replaces the old `useSrdSearch` from `src/api/srd.ts` (which called the backend REST API). The old hooks file still exists and will be removed in FE-034.
  - Both equipment and magic item detail hooks return `null` (not throw) when the item is not found, since the GraphQL queries return nullable types.
---

## 2026-02-07 - FE-033
- Updated `AddItemModal.tsx` to use `useSrdSearch` from `src/api/srd/hooks` instead of old REST-based `src/api/srd`
- Changed import from old `SrdItem` type to new `SrdSearchResult` tagged union type
- Updated `srdToType()` to handle both equipment (using `__typename` for Weapon/Armor discrimination) and magic items (using `source === 'magic-item'`)
- Updated `handleSrdSelect()` to handle both sources: equipment items populate cost/weight from GraphQL data, magic items populate rarity from their rarity field
- Updated dropdown rendering: unique keys use `${source}-${index}`, magic items show a purple "Magic" badge, category display adapts per source type
- Added empty state: shows "No items found" when search returns 0 results and query >= 2 chars
- Search results now include BOTH equipment AND magic items from the live 5e SRD GraphQL API (no longer goes through local backend)
- All quality checks pass (typecheck, lint, ruff, 66 backend tests)
- Files changed: frontend/src/components/items/AddItemModal.tsx, tasks/phase-srd-graphql/prd.json, tasks/phase-srd-graphql/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Equipment search results are a union type — only some subtypes have `equipment_category` (Gear), while others have `weapon_category` (Weapon) or `armor_category` (Armor). Use `'equipment_category' in item` to safely check.
  - Magic items always have `equipment_category` and `rarity` as non-optional fields, while equipment never has `rarity` in search results.
  - The `SrdItem` type in `src/api/types.ts` is now dead code — no components import it. It should be removed in FE-034.
  - The old `src/api/srd.ts` REST hooks file is also dead code now — AddItemModal was its only consumer.
---

## 2026-02-07 - FE-034
- Removed all static SRD data and backend endpoints, completing the migration to live GraphQL queries
- **Deleted files:**
  - `backend/app/data/armor.json`, `gear.json`, `potions.json`, `srd_index.json`, `weapons.json` (5 SRD JSON files)
  - `backend/app/data/` directory (empty after JSON removal)
  - `backend/app/routers/srd.py` (SRD search API endpoint)
  - `backend/app/services/srd.py` (SRD JSON loading/search service)
  - `backend/app/models/srd.py` (SrdItemRead Pydantic schema)
  - `backend/tests/test_srd.py` (5 SRD endpoint tests)
  - `frontend/src/api/srd.ts` (old REST-based SRD hooks)
- **Modified files:**
  - `backend/app/routers/__init__.py` — removed `srd_router` import and export
  - `backend/app/main.py` — removed `srd_router` import and `app.include_router(srd_router)`
  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` — removed `SrdItemRead` import and export
  - `frontend/src/api/types.ts` — removed dead `SrdItem` interface
  - `tasks/phase-srd-graphql/prd.json` — marked FE-034 as passing
- All quality checks pass: ruff lint, typecheck, eslint, 61 backend tests (down from 66 after removing 5 SRD tests)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When removing a backend module, check all 4 layers: router, service, model, and tests — plus their `__init__.py` re-exports
  - The `backend/app/services/__init__.py` did NOT re-export SRD service, but `models/__init__.py` and `routers/__init__.py` did — always check both
  - Frontend `types.ts` can accumulate dead types when modules are replaced — grep for usage before keeping
